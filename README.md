## Statistics & Data Analysis

* [(Non)Correlation between zodiac signs and body weight] Astrologers claim a lot of weird things, including that some zodiac signs make you overweight. In this fun project, I challenge that claim using a survey of 1000+ people. I use Pandas, determine the coefficient of correlation of zodiac signs with weight, and with body-mass index. I also determine the 95% confidence interval for the correlation coefficient, using bootstrapping.

## Resampling Stats in Python
This is a Pythonic "transcription" of Daniel T. Kaplan's 1999 book [_Resampling Stats in Matlab_](http://www.macalester.edu/~kaplan/Resampling/PDF/index.html) using Python 3. It's a short, informative book illustrating the general principles of statistical simulations and, in particular, how *resampling* can be used to obtain confidence intervals for data.

The notebooks below do not contain the full text of the book. I keep explanations at the minimum, and I focus on reimplementing the examples of the book. Occasionally I add my own comments and calculations. Any errors in these additions are my own responsibility.
